    "# Building a stock database using Polygon and Sharadar\n",
    "*Python 3.11.4*\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a financial database of 1-minute OHLCV data from 2005 and beyond, delisted or listed, for common stocks and ADR common stocks. I use Polygon for price data, which is \"ticker-centric\". All data from Polygon is point-in-time by ticker. This means we have to take care of renamings ourselves. Some vendors already do renamings (e.g. Tiingo). And almost all of the vendors that do renamings have a small bit of survivorship-bias, because when a ticker is re-used they do not have them.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Alpaca notebooks (which are now in the archive) I tried to convert tick quote data to quotes and then merge them with bars to get a realistic bid-ask spread. I have decided to not use quote data anymore. It is simply too expensive, cumbersome or simply impossible. I would have to download ALL tick data in order to get quotebars. Instead, I will just trade using 1-minute OHLC. When backtesting, I will assume a spread of 1 tick or a few cents. This is okay, because I simply will not trade HFT or systems with an average profit less than 0.3% for liquid stocks or less than 0.1% for liquid futures/CFDs. High frequency systems also won't work in Europe due to almost not having access to PFOF brokers. I also will avoid illiquid stocks. If I want a more realistic estimate, I will sample the bid-ask spread throughout the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Polygon data will be stored in <code>../../../data/polygon/</code>. This map contains a <code>raw</code> and <code>processed</code> folder. The <code>raw</code> folder will contain the folders <code>m1</code>, <code>adjustments</code>, <code>fundamentals</code>,<code>tickers</code> and <code>cleaned</code>. The <code>processed</code> folder will contain the folders <code>m1</code>, <code>m5</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>d1</code>, <code>w1</code>, <code>m1</code> and <code>fundamentals</code>. Processed data is always adjusted. Raw data is never. Some other data, such as market hours that are not specific to a data vendor, are stored in <code>../../../data/other/</code>. The folders have to be created manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Fundamentals are postponed because I want to focus on getting price data first. I also will postpone cleaning price data because I cannot afford the subscription for tick data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the <code>../../../data/</code> folder the aggregated ticker lists <code>tickers_v{version}.csv</code>are stored. Version 1 is the first aggregated ticker list which has a lot of problems. Version 2 takes care of these problems. Version 3 adds the most liquid ETFs in their category. Version 4 takes care of renamings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Warning: If you think we can just loop through all tickers to get all price and fundamental data, you are in for a surprise. Yes even with the well-documented API from Polygon.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The series of notebooks:\n",
    "1. Get a list of tickers, ticker renamings and market hours.\n",
    "2. Get adjustment factors.\n",
    "3. Download raw 1-minute OHLC data. After converting the Unix timestamp to ET-naive datetimes, the columns are <code>[\"datetime\", \"open\", \"high\", \"low\", \"close\", \"volume\"]</code>.\n",
    "4. Clean suspicious bars with quote/tick data. All cleaned bars are stored in the folder <code>cleaned</code>. **(Postponed because I currently cannot afford the tick data subscription)**\n",
    "5. Process raw data. When data is downloaded for the first time or updated, the *entire* data set needs be processed (for the updated tickers). This is because if new adjustments come in due to dividend or split data, the entire history needs to be readjusted. Processed data will contain the columns <code>[\"open\", \"high\", \"low\", \"close\", \"close_original\", \"volume\", \"tradeable\", \"cleaned\", \"halted\"]</code>. All prices are adjusted, except <code>close_original</code>. The reason we need the original close price is for price filters and fundamentals. Processed data should have no gaps. If data is forward filled, the backtester should not trade these 'stale' prices. Either there have been no trades in the minute or the stock is halted. That is what the <code>tradeable</code> and <code>halted</code> flag is for. The <code>cleaned</code> flag is for if the bar has been cleaned.\n",
    "6. Process ticker changes.\n",
    "7. Aggregate processed 1-minute bars to higher timeframes.\n",
    "8. Get fundamentals from Polygon and Sharadar. **(Postponed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: a data point at 15:59 with OHLC means that the open was at 15:59:00 and close at 16:00:00. So daily data does not contain the 16:00:00 minute bar. My polygon key is in <code>../../../data/polygon/secret.txt</code>, this file has to be created manually, just like the folders.*"

The only way to get the start date of the META or FB is also to loop, but then to track when the ticker appears. Or use the <code>Ticker Events</code> however this only works for current tickers and not delisted ones. So information actually gets lost in the <code>Tickers</code> endpoint.\n",

If the same ticker had different stocks, they are merged when downloading data which we do not want. So we **must** specify a precise start and end date for each stock, else we might get merging from different stocks. And it is not possible to get the start and end dates from <code>list_tickers</code>. Because it simply does not contain the start date. And also not the renamed tickers.\n",
